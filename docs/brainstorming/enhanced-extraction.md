# Enhanced Extraction Capabilities - Brainstorming Session

## 1. Machine Learning for Tool Selection

### Intelligent Tool Routing
- Train ML model on tool performance data
- Features to consider:
  - PDF content type (text, tables, diagrams)
  - Document layout complexity
  - Language and character sets
  - Image quality and resolution
  - Historical success rates

### Adaptive Learning
- Track success/failure rates per tool
- Learn from user corrections
- Adjust tool selection weights dynamically
- Build tool performance profiles

### Predictive Confidence
- Predict confidence scores before extraction
- Route to optimal tool based on predictions
- Reduce processing time by skipping likely-to-fail tools

## 2. Custom Extraction Rules

### Rule Builder Interface
- Visual rule creator
- Pattern matching definitions
- Zone type specifications
- Custom confidence thresholds

### Rule Types
- Layout-based rules (position, size)
- Content-based rules (patterns, keywords)
- Context-aware rules (surrounding content)
- Hybrid rules (combining multiple factors)

### Rule Management
- Rule versioning
- Rule testing framework
- Performance metrics
- Rule sharing/importing

## 3. Template-based Extraction

### Template Creation
