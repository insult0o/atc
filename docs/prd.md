# PDF Processing Platform PRD

## Overview
An AI-powered PDF processing platform that extracts, processes, and manages content from PDF documents with high accuracy and user control. The system uses multiple extraction tools, provides a dual-pane interface for verification, and supports comprehensive export options.

## Core Features

### 1. PDF Content Extraction
- Multi-tool extraction pipeline using unstructured, pdfplumber, pymupdf, camelot, and tabula
- Content type support: paragraphs, tables, diagrams/charts
- Zone-based processing with tool-specific metadata
- Confidence scoring and thresholds:
  - Paragraphs: ≥ 0.80
  - Tables: ≥ 0.70
  - Diagrams: ≥ 0.60

### 2. Dual-Pane Interface
- Split view showing original PDF and extracted content
- Visual confidence indicators (bright vs greyed out)
- Interactive zone selection and reprocessing
- Manual correction capabilities
- Undo/revert functionality

### 3. Processing Pipeline
- Tool priority and fallback system
- Weighted confidence merging
- Error handling and placeholder insertion
- Manual intervention flagging
- Zone-specific metadata tracking

### 4. Export System
- Multiple output formats (RAG JSON, JSONL, logs)
- Export validation and blocking
- Partial export support
- Comprehensive logging and manifest generation

## User Stories

### Content Extraction
1. As a user, I want to upload a PDF and have it automatically processed
2. As a user, I want to see which extraction tool was used for each zone
3. As a user, I want to know the confidence level for each extracted element
4. As a user, I want to be notified of extraction failures

### Content Review & Editing
1. As a user, I want to compare original and extracted content side by side
2. As a user, I want to manually select zones for reprocessing
3. As a user, I want to edit extracted content directly
4. As a user, I want to undo my changes or revert to automatic extraction

### Export & Management
1. As a user, I want to export processed content in multiple formats
2. As a user, I want to export specific pages or zones
3. As a user, I want to see a log of all processing decisions
4. As a user, I want to track manual corrections and changes

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind v4 styling
- Dual-pane viewer component
- Interactive zone selection
- Real-time confidence visualization

### Backend
- Python/TypeScript hybrid architecture
- Tool integration and orchestration
- Confidence calculation engine
- Export format generation
- Logging and manifest system

### Processing Pipeline
- Tool priority system
- Fallback mechanism
- Confidence threshold enforcement
- Manual override handling
- Error management

### Export System
- JSON schema validation
- Export blocking logic
- Partial export handling
- Log and manifest generation

## Data Schemas

### Zone Metadata
```json
{
  "zone_id": "string",
  "tool": "string",
  "confidence": "number",
  "type": "table|text|diagram",
  "page": "number",
  "status": "auto|manual_override|error"
}
```

### Export Structure
```
/output/docX/
    ├── rag_chunks.json      # RAG-ready content
    ├── fine_tune.jsonl      # Training data
    ├── corrections.json     # Manual corrections
    ├── zone_manifest.json   # Zone metadata
    └── export_log.md        # Processing history
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Tool processing timeout: 30 seconds per zone
- UI responsiveness: < 100ms for zone highlighting
- Export generation: < 5 seconds for standard documents

### Security
- Input validation for all PDF uploads
- Secure storage of processed content
- User action audit logging

### Reliability
- Automatic tool fallback on failure
- Data preservation during processing
- Manual correction backup

## Success Metrics
1. Extraction accuracy:
   - Text: > 95% correct
   - Tables: > 90% correct
   - Diagrams: > 85% correct

2. User Experience:
   - < 3 manual corrections per page
   - < 2 tool fallbacks per document
   - < 1 minute average processing time

3. System Reliability:
   - 99.9% uptime
   - < 0.1% failed exports
   - < 1% extraction errors

## Future Considerations
1. Additional extraction tools integration
2. Machine learning for tool selection
3. Batch processing capabilities
4. API access for automation
5. Custom extraction rules
