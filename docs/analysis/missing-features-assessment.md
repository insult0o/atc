  - Position calculation accuracy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS

#### 6. **Epic 4 Backend Not Implemented**
- **Planned but Missing**:
  - FastAPI backend server
  - Database integration (Supabase)
  - WebSocket real-time updates
  - Frontend-Backend integration
  - API endpoints
  - Data persistence

#### 7. **Content Processing Pipeline Gaps**
- **Current Issues**:
  - No fallback extraction methods
  - Missing content areas
  - Lost formatting during extraction
  - Images not processed for display

### üîß UX/UI MISSING FEATURES

#### 8. **Missing Visual Feedback Systems**
- **Not Implemented**:
  - Loading states during processing
  - Error indicators for failed extractions
  - Confidence visualization in content
  - Progress bars for large documents

#### 9. **Limited Zone Interaction**
- **Missing**:
  - Zone boundary adjustment from content side
  - Zone type changing from editor
  - Zone merging/splitting
  - Advanced zone operations

#### 10. **No Accessibility Features**
- **Missing**:
  - Keyboard navigation between panes
  - Screen reader support
  - High contrast mode
  - Focus management
  - ARIA labels

### ‚úÖ WHAT IS WORKING

1. **Basic PDF Viewing**
   - PDF.js integration functional
   - Page navigation working
   - Zoom controls operational

2. **Zone System Basics**
   - Zone detection and display
   - Zone highlighting overlay
   - Basic zone selection

3. **Layout Features**
   - Dual-pane layout
   - Resizable panes with divider
   - Mobile responsive design

4. **Basic Editing**
   - Per-zone content editing
   - Copy functionality
   - Simple text updates

5. **Export System**
   - Export format generation implemented
   - Validation system in place
   - Partial export support designed

## Impact Analysis

### High Impact (Blocks Core Functionality)
1. **Incomplete text extraction** - Users can't see all document content
2. **No cross-highlighting** - Core UX feature missing
3. **No backend** - No persistence or real functionality
4. **Poor table/image support** - Major content types unsupported

### Medium Impact (Degrades Experience)
1. **Limited editor** - Basic editing only
2. **Scroll sync issues** - Navigation problems
3. **No visual feedback** - Confusing UX
4. **Missing zone features** - Limited manipulation

### Low Impact (Nice to Have)
1. **Accessibility** - Important but not blocking
2. **Advanced features** - Can be added later

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Architecture Decisions**
- Zone-dependent text extraction creates gaps
- No fallback mechanisms implemented
- Tight coupling between zones and content

### 2. **Implementation Priorities**
- Focus on component creation over integration
- Backend deferred (Epic 4 not started)
- Missing end-to-end feature completion

### 3. **Technical Gaps**
- Coordinate mapping not fully implemented
- Event systems not connected
- State synchronization incomplete

## Recommended Solution Path

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement complete text extraction pipeline
2. Add cross-highlighting system
3. Fix synchronized scrolling
4. Complete table/image display

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation (4-6 weeks)
1. Deploy Epic 4 infrastructure
2. Connect all components
3. Add real-time updates
4. Implement persistence

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)
1. Rich text editor integration
2. Advanced zone interactions
3. Visual feedback systems
4. Accessibility improvements

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made on individual components, the platform lacks critical integration and core features that prevent it from being functional. The most pressing needs are:

1. **Complete text extraction** - Without this, users miss content
2. **Cross-highlighting** - Essential for the dual-pane UX
3. **Backend infrastructure** - Required for any real usage
4. **Proper content display** - Tables and images must work

These missing features represent approximately 8-10 weeks of additional development work to reach a truly functional MVP state.
