# Story 2.1: Dual-Pane Viewer Implementation

## Overview
Implement a sophisticated dual-pane interface that displays the original PDF alongside extracted content, with synchronized scrolling, zone highlighting, and responsive layout. This story establishes the foundation for all UI interaction features in Epic 2.

## User Story
As a user, I want to see the original PDF and extracted content side by side with synchronized scrolling and zone highlighting, so that I can easily verify extraction accuracy and navigate between source and results.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Left pane displays the original PDF with full rendering fidelity
2. Right pane shows extracted content in a clean, formatted view
3. Scrolling in either pane synchronizes the other pane's position
4. Zones are highlighted in both panes with matching colors
5. Content formatting and structure are preserved in the extracted view
6. Layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
7. Pane sizes can be adjusted with a draggable divider
8. Zone highlighting can be toggled on/off for clarity

- Create efficient re-render management
- Implement lazy loading for PDF pages
- Add performance monitoring and metrics
- **File Location**: `app/hooks/useViewerPerformance.ts`
- **Unit Tests**: Performance metrics, optimization effectiveness

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Epic 1:** 
- PDFViewer component exists with basic PDF.js integration
- ZoneManager provides zone data and state management
- WebSocket infrastructure enables real-time updates
- Confidence scoring data available for visual enhancement

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
interface DualPaneViewerProps {
  documentId: string;
  zones: Zone[];
  extractedContent: ExtractedContent[];
  onZoneSelect?: (zoneId: string) => void;
  onContentEdit?: (zoneId: string, content: string) => void;
}

interface ViewerState {
  leftPaneScroll: ScrollPosition;
  rightPaneScroll: ScrollPosition;
  selectedZone: string | null;
  highlightVisible: boolean;
  paneRatio: number; // 0-1 for left pane width
  zoomLevel: number;
}
```

### Canvas Overlay Strategy
```typescript
// Zone highlighting on PDF canvas
interface CanvasOverlay {
  drawZone(zone: Zone, color: string, opacity: number): void;
  clearZones(): void;
  updateViewport(viewport: PDFViewport): void;
  handleInteraction(event: MouseEvent): Zone | null;
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Initial render: < 500ms
- Scroll synchronization lag: < 16ms (60fps)
- Zone highlight update: < 50ms
- Memory usage: < 200MB for 100-page document

### Integration Points
1. **ZoneManager**: Subscribe to zone updates via context
2. **WebSocket**: Real-time zone and content updates
3. **ConfidenceVisualizer**: Overlay confidence indicators
4. **Document Store**: Access processed content and metadata

### Mobile Considerations
- Single pane view with toggle between PDF/content
- Touch-optimized zone selection
- Pinch-to-zoom support
- Reduced canvas overlays for performance

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation between panes and zones
- Screen reader support for extracted content
- High contrast mode for zone highlights
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

## Definition of Done
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria met with test coverage
2. ✅ Dual-pane viewer renders PDF and content side-by-side
3. ✅ Scroll synchronization works smoothly in both directions
4. ✅ Zone highlighting is accurate and performant
5. ✅ Responsive layout works on desktop and mobile
6. ✅ Performance targets met for large documents
7. ✅ Accessibility requirements implemented
8. ✅ Integration tests with Epic 1 components pass
9. ✅ Code reviewed and documented
10. ✅ User acceptance testing completed

## Story Points: 13
**Justification**: High complexity due to canvas rendering, scroll synchronization, and performance requirements. Significant UI/UX work with responsive design needs.

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 Stories 4-7 (Completed)
- PDF.js library (Already integrated)
- Canvas API expertise
- React performance optimization knowledge

## Risks
1. **Scroll synchronization performance** - Mitigate with debouncing and RAF
2. **Canvas rendering on mobile** - Mitigate with simplified overlays
3. **Memory usage with large PDFs** - Mitigate with virtual scrolling
4. **Browser compatibility** - Test across major browsers early
