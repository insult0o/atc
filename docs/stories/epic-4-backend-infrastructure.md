# Epic 4: Backend Infrastructure and Integration

## Overview
Implement the complete backend infrastructure to connect all frontend components with processing services, enabling a fully functional PDF Intelligence Platform with real-time updates and persistent storage.

## User Stories

### Story 4.1: FastAPI Backend Implementation
**As a** system  
**I want to** have a robust API layer  
**So that** frontend components can communicate with processing services

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. FastAPI server with proper project structure
2. RESTful endpoints for all operations
3. Request/response validation with Pydantic
4. Error handling and status codes
5. CORS configuration for frontend access
6. API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
7. Endpoint versioning support
8. Request logging and monitoring

#### Technical Notes
- FastAPI with async/await patterns
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Structured error responses
- Middleware for logging and metrics
- Environment-based configuration

### Story 4.2: Database Integration and Schema
**As a** system  
**I want to** persist all platform data  
**So that** users can access their documents and processing history

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase project setup and configuration
2. PostgreSQL schema for all entities
3. Document and zone metadata storage
4. Processing history tracking
5. Export records management
6. User session data storage
7. Database migrations system
8. Connection pooling and optimization

#### Technical Notes
- Supabase client integration
- TypeScript types from database schema
- Row-level security policies
- Indexed queries for performance
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Story 4.3: WebSocket Real-time Updates
**As a** user  
**I want to** see processing progress in real-time  
**So that** I know the status of my document processing

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WebSocket server implementation
2. Real-time processing status updates
3. Progress events for long operations
4. Connection management and reconnection
5. Event broadcasting to specific clients
6. Error handling for disconnections
7. Message queuing for reliability
8. Performance optimization for scale

#### Technical Notes
- Socket.io or native WebSocket
- Event-driven architecture
- Redis for pub/sub if needed
- Connection state management
- Heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism

### Story 4.4: Frontend-Backend Integration
**As a** developer  
**I want to** seamlessly connect UI components to backend services  
**So that** the platform functions as a cohesive system

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. API client utilities for frontend
2. State management integration
3. Error boundary implementation
4. Loading and error states
5. Optimistic UI updates
6. Request caching strategy
7. File upload handling
8. Export download management

#### Technical Notes
- Axios or Fetch API wrapper
- Zustand/Redux for state
- React Query for caching
- Error boundary components
- Progress upload/download tracking

## Dependencies
- FastAPI and Python environment
- Supabase account and project
- Redis for caching/queuing
- WebSocket library
- Frontend state management

## Technical Risks
1. WebSocket connection stability
2. Large file upload handling
3. Database query performance
4. Real-time update latency
5. State synchronization complexity

## Story Points
- Story 4.1: 13 points
- Story 4.2: 8 points
- Story 4.3: 8 points
- Story 4.4: 13 points
Total: 42 points

## Definition of Done
1. All endpoints implemented and tested
2. Database schema deployed and optimized
3. WebSocket updates working reliably
4. Frontend fully integrated with backend
5. Error handling comprehensive
6. Performance metrics acceptable
7. Documentation complete
8. Integration tests passing
