# Story 7: Confidence Scoring and Merging

## Overview
Implement an advanced confidence scoring and result merging system that combines outputs from multiple tools, calculates weighted confidence scores, enforces quality thresholds, and intelligently merges results when needed. This story completes Epic 1 by providing the final layer of quality assurance and result optimization for the PDF processing pipeline.

## User Story
As a system, I want to calculate accurate confidence scores for all extraction results, merge outputs from multiple tools when beneficial, and enforce quality thresholds to ensure only high-quality content is presented to users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each tool provides accurate confidence scores based on extraction quality metrics
2. Confidence scores are weighted by tool priority, content type, and historical performance
3. Final confidence scores are calculated using sophisticated merging algorithms
4. Quality thresholds are enforced with automatic re-processing triggers
5. Results from multiple tools are intelligently merged when they improve overall quality
6. Users can adjust confidence thresholds and merging preferences
7. Confidence trends are tracked over time for system optimization
8. Visual confidence indicators help users identify areas needing attention
