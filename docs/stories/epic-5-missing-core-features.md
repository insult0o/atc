**I want to** see and edit tables and images from my PDF  
**So that** all content types are properly handled

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Display tables with proper structure
2. Enable table cell editing
3. Add/remove table rows and columns
4. Display extracted images inline
5. Support image zoom and pan
6. Maintain image-text relationships
7. Export tables in multiple formats
8. Handle complex table layouts

### Story 5.5: Advanced Zone Interaction
**As a** user  
**I want to** manipulate zones from both PDF and content views  
**So that** I have full control over content organization

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Adjust zone boundaries from content editor
2. Merge multiple zones into one
3. Split zones at cursor position
4. Change zone types dynamically
5. Reorder zones in content view
6. Delete zones with content preservation
7. Create zones from content selection
8. Batch zone operations

#### Technical Notes
- Bidirectional zone manipulation
- Zone state synchronization
- Implement zone algebra operations
- Create visual zone editor
- Handle zone conflicts

### Story 5.6: Visual Feedback Systems
**As a** user  
**I want to** see clear status indicators during all operations  
**So that** I understand what the system is doing

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Loading states for all async operations
2. Progress bars for long operations
3. Error messages with recovery options
4. Success confirmations
5. Processing status per zone
6. Confidence indicators in content
7. Auto-dismiss notifications
8. Operation history log

#### Technical Notes
- Create notification system
