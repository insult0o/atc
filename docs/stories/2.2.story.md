# Story 2.2: Zone Selection and Editing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive zone selection and editing capabilities that allow users to interactively select zones, create new zones through drag-selection, adjust zone boundaries, change zone types, and directly edit extracted content with automatic saving and real-time updates.

## User Story
As a user, I want to select and edit zones by clicking, dragging to create new zones, adjusting boundaries, changing zone types, and editing content directly, so that I can correct extraction errors and improve document processing accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can select zones by clicking on them in either pane
2. Drag-select on PDF creates new zones with visual feedback
3. Zone boundaries can be adjusted by dragging edges and corners
4. Zone type can be changed via dropdown or context menu
5. Content can be edited directly in the extracted content pane
6. All changes are saved automatically with optimistic updates
7. Undo/redo functionality for all zone operations
8. Multi-zone selection with bulk operations support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.1:** Dual-pane viewer with canvas overlay system established
**From Epic 1:** Zone data structure and processing pipeline ready

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
interface ZoneEditingState {
  selectedZones: Set<string>;
  editingZone: string | null;
  dragState: DragState | null;
  undoStack: ZoneCommand[];
  redoStack: ZoneCommand[];
  pendingChanges: Map<string, ZoneChange>;
}

interface ZoneCommand {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
  description: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface DragState {
  type: 'create' | 'resize' | 'move';
  startPoint: Point;
  currentPoint: Point;
  targetZone?: Zone;
  handle?: ResizeHandle;
}
```

### Canvas Interaction Layer
```typescript
// Mouse event handling for zone operations
interface ZoneInteractionHandler {
  onMouseDown(event: MouseEvent): void;
  onMouseMove(event: MouseEvent): void;
  onMouseUp(event: MouseEvent): void;
  onKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent): void;
  getCursorStyle(point: Point): string;
}
```

### Real-time Synchronization
```typescript
// WebSocket events for zone editing
interface ZoneEditEvents {
  'zone:created': (zone: Zone) => void;
  'zone:updated': (zoneId: string, changes: Partial<Zone>) => void;
  'zone:deleted': (zoneId: string) => void;
  'zone:locked': (zoneId: string, userId: string) => void;
  'zone:unlocked': (zoneId: string) => void;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce content editing saves (500ms)
- Batch zone operations for undo/redo
- Optimize canvas redraws with dirty rectangles
- Limit undo history to 50 operations
- Use Web Workers for complex calculations

### Drag Operation Visual Feedback
- Rubber band selection with semi-transparent overlay
- Resize handles with 8-point control
- Snap guides when near edges or other zones
- Live preview of content reflow
- Cursor changes based on operation type

### Content Editing Features
- Rich text support (bold, italic, lists)
- Table editing for structured data
- Formula preservation for mathematical content
- Code syntax highlighting
- Spell check integration

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard-only zone selection and editing
- Screen reader announcements for operations
- High contrast mode for editing UI
- Focus management during operations

## Definition of Done
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria met with test coverage
2. ✅ Zone selection works reliably in both panes
3. ✅ Drag-to-create zones with proper visual feedback
4. ✅ Zone resizing with constraints and snapping
5. ✅ Zone type changes trigger appropriate re-processing
6. ✅ Content editing with auto-save and optimistic updates
7. ✅ Undo/redo system with 50-operation history
8. ✅ WebSocket synchronization for all operations
9. ✅ Performance targets met (60fps interactions)
10. ✅ Accessibility requirements implemented

## Story Points: 8
**Justification**: Complex interaction handling, state management for undo/redo, and real-time synchronization requirements. Moderate complexity compared to dual-pane viewer.

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1 (Dual-Pane Viewer) - Recommended completion first
- Epic 1 Zone Manager infrastructure
- WebSocket connection from Epic 1
- Canvas interaction expertise

## Risks
1. **Complex mouse interaction handling** - Mitigate with robust state machine
2. **Undo/redo complexity** - Mitigate with command pattern
3. **Performance with many zones** - Mitigate with spatial indexing
4. **Concurrent editing conflicts** - Mitigate with optimistic locking
