# Epic 1: PDF Processing Core Functionality

## Overview
Implement the core PDF processing functionality including file upload, zone detection, tool integration, and confidence scoring.

## User Stories

### Story 1.1: PDF Upload and Initial Processing
**As a** user  
**I want to** upload a PDF document  
**So that** I can extract and process its content

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can drag-drop or select PDF file
2. System validates PDF format and size
3. Upload progress is displayed
4. Initial processing status is shown
5. Zones are automatically detected
6. Processing tools are initialized

#### Technical Notes
- Max file size: 100MB
- Supported formats: PDF 1.4+
- Upload endpoint: `/api/upload`
- WebSocket updates for progress

### Story 1.2: Zone Detection and Tool Assignment
**As a** system  
**I want to** detect content zones and assign appropriate tools  
**So that** content can be extracted efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies text, table, and diagram zones
2. Each zone is assigned a primary tool
3. Zone metadata is generated
4. Tool assignments follow priority rules
5. Zone boundaries are clearly marked

#### Technical Notes
- Use PDF.js for initial rendering
- Canvas-based zone detection
- Tool priority configuration
- Zone metadata schema

### Story 1.3: Content Extraction Pipeline
**As a** system  
**I want to** process each zone with assigned tools  
**So that** content is extracted accurately

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tools process zones in priority order
2. Confidence scores are calculated
3. Fallback logic is implemented
4. Processing status is tracked
5. Errors are handled gracefully

#### Technical Notes
- Tool execution timeouts
- Confidence calculation rules
- Error handling strategy
- Status tracking via WebSocket

### Story 1.4: Confidence Scoring and Merging
**As a** system  
**I want to** calculate and merge confidence scores  
**So that** the best results are presented

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Each tool provides confidence score
2. Scores are weighted by tool priority
3. Final confidence is calculated
4. Thresholds are enforced
5. Results are merged when needed

#### Technical Notes
- Confidence thresholds by type
- Weighted average calculation
- Merge strategy implementation
- Threshold configuration

## Dependencies
- PDF processing tools installed
- WebSocket server configured
- Storage system ready
- Frontend components created

## Technical Risks
1. Tool installation complexity
2. Processing performance
3. Memory management
4. Error handling edge cases

## Story Points
- Story 1.1: 5 points
