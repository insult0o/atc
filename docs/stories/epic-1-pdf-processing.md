# Epic 1: PDF Processing Core

## Overview
Implement the core PDF processing functionality including file upload, zone detection, and tool management.

## User Stories

### Story 1: PDF Upload and Initial Processing
**As a user, I want to upload a PDF and have it automatically processed**

Tasks:
1. Create PDF upload component with drag-drop
2. Implement file validation
3. Add upload progress indicator
4. Create backend upload endpoint
5. Implement initial PDF parsing
6. Add WebSocket connection for progress updates

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Supports drag-drop and file selection
- [ ] Validates PDF format and size
- [ ] Shows upload progress
- [ ] Displays processing status
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully

### Story 2: Zone Detection and Tool Assignment
**As a user, I want the system to identify zones and assign appropriate tools**

Tasks:
1. Implement zone detection algorithm
2. Create tool priority system
3. Add tool assignment logic
4. Implement zone metadata storage
5. Create zone visualization component
6. Add tool assignment feedback

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Correctly identifies text, table, and diagram zones
- [ ] Assigns most appropriate tool per zone
- [ ] Stores zone metadata
- [ ] Visualizes zones in UI
- [ ] Shows tool assignments

### Story 3: Content Extraction Pipeline
**As a user, I want the system to extract content using multiple tools**

Tasks:
1. Implement tool manager service
2. Add tool execution pipeline
3. Create confidence calculation system
4. Implement fallback mechanism
5. Add extraction progress tracking
6. Create extraction result storage

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Successfully extracts content using all tools
- [ ] Calculates confidence scores
- [ ] Handles tool failures gracefully
- [ ] Shows extraction progress
- [ ] Stores results properly

### Story 4: Confidence Management
**As a user, I want to see confidence levels for extracted content**

Tasks:
1. Implement confidence visualization
2. Add threshold management
3. Create confidence merging logic
4. Implement confidence updates
5. Add confidence history tracking

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Shows confidence scores clearly
- [ ] Applies correct thresholds
- [ ] Merges multiple tool results
- [ ] Updates in real-time
- [ ] Tracks confidence history
