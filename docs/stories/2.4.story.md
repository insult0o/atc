# Story 2.4: Manual Override Controls

## Overview
Implement comprehensive manual override controls that allow users to select different extraction tools, manually edit content with automatic confidence adjustment, track changes with version history, and provide undo/revert capabilities for all manual interventions.

## User Story
As a user, I want to manually override extraction results by selecting different tools, editing content directly, and reverting changes when needed, so that I can ensure the highest quality output when automatic extraction falls short.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can select and apply different extraction tools to any zone
2. Manual edits are clearly tracked and distinguished from automatic extractions
3. Confidence is automatically set to 100% for manual overrides
4. Previous versions are preserved with full history
5. Undo/revert functionality available for all changes
6. Override status is clearly indicated visually
7. Batch operations support for multiple zones
8. Override reasons can be documented

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.2:** Zone selection and editing infrastructure in place
**From Story 2.3:** Confidence visualization system available
**From Epic 1:** Tool ecosystem and processing pipeline ready

### Override Data Model
```typescript
interface ManualOverride {
  id: string;
  zoneId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  userId: string;
  type: 'tool_change' | 'content_edit' | 'zone_adjustment';
  previousValue: any;
  newValue: any;
  confidence: 1.0; // Always 100% for manual overrides
  reason?: string;
  metadata: {
    tool?: string;
    processingTime?: number;
    userNotes?: string;
  };
}

interface VersionHistory {
  zoneId: string;
  versions: Version[];
  currentVersion: number;
  overrideCount: number;
}
```

### Tool Selection Strategy
```typescript
interface ToolSelectionContext {
  availableTools: Tool[];
  recommendedTools: Tool[];
  compatibilityMatrix: Map<ZoneType, Tool[]>;
  toolPerformanceHistory: Map<string, PerformanceMetrics>;
  costEstimates: Map<string, number>;
}
```

### Undo/Redo Enhancement
```typescript
// Extended command pattern for overrides
interface OverrideCommand extends ZoneCommand {
  category: 'override';
  impact: 'single' | 'batch';
  versionsAffected: string[];
  canGroupWith(other: OverrideCommand): boolean;
  preview(): OverridePreview;
}
```

### Visual Design for Overrides
- Override badge: Blue color (#2196F3)
- Manual edit icon: ✏️ or user icon
- Version indicator: Clock icon with count
- Confidence boost indicator: ⬆️ 100%
- Batch selection: Checkbox overlay

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load version history
- Compress stored versions
- Index overrides for fast filtering
- Cache tool recommendations
- Optimize batch operations

### Audit Trail Requirements
```typescript
interface AuditEntry {
  action: 'manual_override';
  timestamp: number;
  user: string;
  details: {
    zonesAffected: string[];
    previousConfidence: number;
    overrideType: string;
    reason?: string;
  };
  reversible: boolean;
}
```

## Definition of Done
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria met with test coverage
2. ✅ Tool selection works for single and multiple zones
3. ✅ Manual edits tracked with full metadata
4. ✅ Version history with efficient storage
5. ✅ Undo/revert works reliably
6. ✅ Override status clearly visible
7. ✅ Batch operations perform efficiently
8. ✅ Audit trail captures all changes
9. ✅ Integration with existing systems smooth
10. ✅ Performance targets met (<100ms operations)

## Story Points: 8
**Justification**: Complex state management for versions and history, integration with multiple systems, and sophisticated UI requirements. Originally estimated at 3 points but increased to 8 based on technical complexity.

## Dependencies
- Story 2.2 (Zone Selection and Editing) - Provides selection infrastructure
- Story 2.3 (Confidence Visualization) - Visual framework
- Epic 1 tool ecosystem
- Undo/redo system from 2.2

## Risks
1. **Version storage growth** - Mitigate with compression and pruning
2. **Undo complexity with dependencies** - Mitigate with careful command design
3. **Tool compatibility issues** - Mitigate with validation matrix
4. **Performance with many overrides** - Mitigate with indexing
