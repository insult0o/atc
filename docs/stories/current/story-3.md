# Story 3: Project Foundation and Tech Stack Setup

## Overview
Establish the proper project foundation according to the architecture, including essential dependencies, folder structure, and core configurations.

## User Story
As a developer, I want the project to have the proper foundation with all architectural dependencies and structure so that I can build features according to the specification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All architectural dependencies installed with correct versions
- [ ] Proper folder structure according to architecture
- [ ] Basic type definitions and shared interfaces
- [ ] Development configuration properly set up
- [ ] Basic component structure with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Foundation ready for PDF viewer and processing implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Install Architecture Dependencies ✅
- Install @supabase/supabase-js ^2.38.0 ✅
- Install @tanstack/react-query ^5.0.0 ✅
- Install PDF.js ^4.0.0 (already installed) ✅
- Install Zustand ^4.4.0 (already installed) ✅
- Upgrade Tailwind to v4.x ✅
- Install missing TypeScript types ✅

### 2. Setup Project Structure ✅
- Create lib/ directory for backend logic ✅
- Create packages/shared/ for shared types ✅
- Update folder structure to match architecture ✅
- Create proper barrel exports ✅

### 3. Create Shared Type Definitions ✅
- Define Zone interface from architecture ✅
- Define ProcessingStatus interface ✅
- Define WebSocket event types ✅
- Create API endpoint interfaces ✅
- Export shared types package ✅

### 4. Setup Development Configuration ✅
- Configure React Query provider ✅
- Setup Zustand store structure ✅
- Create basic error boundaries ✅
- Configure TypeScript paths ✅
- Setup development utilities ✅

### 5. Create Foundation Components ✅
- Update existing components to match architecture interfaces ✅
- Create basic layout components ✅
- Setup component barrel exports ✅
- Ensure all components are properly typed ✅

## Dev Notes
- Follow exact versions from architecture tech stack table
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Use exact interfaces defined in architecture document
- Maintain compatibility with existing upload functionality

## Testing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No dependency conflicts
- [ ] Basic components render without errors
- [ ] Development server runs successfully
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
