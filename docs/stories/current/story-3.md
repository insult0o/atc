# Story 3: Project Foundation and Tech Stack Setup

## Overview
Establish the proper project foundation according to the architecture, including essential dependencies, folder structure, and core configurations.

## User Story
As a developer, I want the project to have the proper foundation with all architectural dependencies and structure so that I can build features according to the specification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All architectural dependencies installed with correct versions
- [ ] Proper folder structure according to architecture
- [ ] Basic type definitions and shared interfaces
- [ ] Development configuration properly set up
- [ ] Basic component structure with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Foundation ready for PDF viewer and processing implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Install Architecture Dependencies âœ…
- Install @supabase/supabase-js ^2.38.0 âœ…
- Install @tanstack/react-query ^5.0.0 âœ…
- Install PDF.js ^4.0.0 (already installed) âœ…
- Install Zustand ^4.4.0 (already installed) âœ…
- Upgrade Tailwind to v4.x âœ…
- Install missing TypeScript types âœ…

### 2. Setup Project Structure âœ…
- Create lib/ directory for backend logic âœ…
- Create packages/shared/ for shared types âœ…
- Update folder structure to match architecture âœ…
- Create proper barrel exports âœ…

### 3. Create Shared Type Definitions âœ…
- Define Zone interface from architecture âœ…
- Define ProcessingStatus interface âœ…
- Define WebSocket event types âœ…
- Create API endpoint interfaces âœ…
- Export shared types package âœ…

### 4. Setup Development Configuration âœ…
- Configure React Query provider âœ…
- Setup Zustand store structure âœ…
- Create basic error boundaries âœ…
- Configure TypeScript paths âœ…
- Setup development utilities âœ…

### 5. Create Foundation Components âœ…
- Update existing components to match architecture interfaces âœ…
- Create basic layout components âœ…
- Setup component barrel exports âœ…
- Ensure all components are properly typed âœ…

## Dev Notes
- Follow exact versions from architecture tech stack table
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Use exact interfaces defined in architecture document
- Maintain compatibility with existing upload functionality

## Testing
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (all issues resolved)
- [x] No dependency conflicts
- [x] Basic components render without errors
- [x] Development server runs successfully
- [x] All imports resolve correctly

### Change Log
- Created Story 3 for project foundation setup

## Status
QA Review Completed - **FULLY APPROVED** âœ…

See: [Story 3 QA Review](./story-3-qa.md) for detailed analysis.

All TypeScript compilation issues have been resolved. Ready for next story implementation. 

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps Following BMAD v4:**

### **1. Create Story 4 (Immediate Next Action)**
According to the BMAD methodology, you should create the next story using the proper BMAD task:

```bash
# Use the BMAD create-next-story task
/BMad create-next-story
```

**Or in Cursor/Claude, use:**
```
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

### **2. Expected Story 4 Scope**
Based on the **Development Plan** and **Epic 1: PDF Processing Core**, Story 4 should likely be:

**"PDF Upload and Initial Processing"** covering:
- âœ… Core PDF upload interface (foundation ready)
- ðŸ”„ PDF.js viewer integration  
- ðŸ”„ Initial zone detection
- ðŸ”„ WebSocket progress tracking
- ðŸ”„ File validation and storage

### **3. BMAD Infrastructure Available**
Your project is properly configured with:
- âœ… **Core Config**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` 
- âœ… **Story Location**: `docs/stories/`
- âœ… **Architecture v4**: Sharded architecture docs ready
- âœ… **Agent Commands**: `/analyst`, `/architect`, `/dev` etc.
- âœ… **Task Commands**: `/create-doc`, `/review-story` etc.

### **4. Story Creation Process (BMAD v4)**
The BMAD task will automatically:

1. **Analyze Epic Structure** - Review Epic 1 requirements
2. **Gather Architecture Context** - Pull relevant technical details from `docs/architecture/`
3. **Review Previous Stories** - Incorporate lessons from Stories 1-3
4. **Generate Comprehensive Story** - Create `4.1.story.md` with:
   - Complete technical specifications
   - Architecture-aligned implementation details
   - Detailed task breakdown
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Testing requirements

### **5. Recommended Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Create next story
/BMad create-next-story

# Step 2: Review the generated story
/BMad validate-next-story

# Step 3: Begin implementation with dev agent
/dev "implement story 4"
```

### **6. Current Project Status Summary**
- âœ… **Stories 1-3**: Complete with QA approval
- âœ… **Foundation**: TypeScript, dependencies, architecture ready
- âœ… **Infrastructure**: BMAD v4 fully operational
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Story 4 - Core PDF processing functionality

**Ready to proceed with Story 4 creation using BMAD-METHOD v4 workflow!**

Would you like me to help you run the create-next-story task, or would you prefer to use the BMAD commands directly?
