# Story: Real-time Upload Progress with WebSocket

## Overview
Implement WebSocket integration for real-time upload progress and status updates.

## User Story
As a user, I want to see real-time progress updates during file upload and processing so that I can track the status of my uploads accurately.

## Tasks
1. Create WebSocket Server ✅
   - Set up FastAPI WebSocket endpoint
   - Implement connection management
   - Add authentication (if required)
   - Handle connection errors

2. Implement Progress Tracking
   - Create progress calculation system
   - Track upload progress
   - Track processing progress
   - Handle progress events

3. Add WebSocket Client ✅
   - Implement WebSocket connection in frontend
   - Add reconnection logic
   - Handle connection state
   - Manage message queue

4. Update UI Components
   - Enhance progress bar with real-time updates
   - Add detailed status messages
   - Show processing stages
   - Handle connection status

5. Implement Error Handling ✅
   - Handle connection failures
   - Manage reconnection attempts
   - Show connection status
   - Provide fallback mechanism

6. Add Connection Management ✅
   - Track active connections
   - Clean up on disconnect
   - Handle multiple clients
   - Manage resources

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] WebSocket connection established successfully
- [ ] Real-time progress updates shown in UI
- [x] Connection status indicated to user
- [x] Automatic reconnection on failure
- [x] Graceful fallback to polling if needed
- [x] Clean connection termination

## Technical Notes
- Use FastAPI WebSocket support ✅
- Implement proper error handling ✅
- Add comprehensive logging ✅
- Follow TypeScript best practices ✅
- Write Playwright tests ✅

## Dependencies
- FastAPI backend ✅
- WebSocket support ✅
- Frontend state management ✅
- UI components

## Estimated Effort
- Backend: 1 day ✅
- Frontend: 1 day (0.5 days remaining)
- Testing: 1 day ✅
Total: 3 days (0.5 days remaining)

## Dev Notes
- Start with basic WebSocket setup ✅
- Test with small files first ✅
- Add reconnection logic incrementally ✅
- Consider load testing

## Progress
- WebSocket server implemented
- Client hook created
- Connection management working
- Tests implemented
- Remaining: UI integration and progress tracking
