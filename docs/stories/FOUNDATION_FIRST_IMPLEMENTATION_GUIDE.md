## üìã **FOUNDATION STORIES COMPLETED**

### ‚úÖ **Story 7.5: Sophisticated State Management Integration**
üìÑ [`docs/stories/7.5.story.md`](./7.5.story.md)
- **130+ KB** of advanced state management ready for integration
- Real-time updates, undo/redo, complex workflow support
- 8-phase detailed implementation plan with hooks and stores
- **CRITICAL**: Enables all other Epic 7 features

### ‚úÖ **Story 7.6: Notification & Feedback System Integration**
üìÑ [`docs/stories/7.6.story.md`](./7.6.story.md)
- **30+ KB** of comprehensive user feedback system
- Toast notifications, loading states, progress tracking, error handling
- 8-phase implementation with global notification management
- **FOUNDATION**: User communication for all operations

### ‚úÖ **Story 7.10: WebSocket & Real-Time Infrastructure Integration**
üìÑ [`docs/stories/7.10.story.md`](./7.10.story.md)
- **50+ KB** of real-time communication infrastructure

## üéØ **FOUNDATION FIRST IMPLEMENTATION ORDER**

### **Week 1: Story 7.5 - State Management** (MOST CRITICAL)
```bash
# Start here - this enables everything else
cd docs/stories
cat 7.5.story.md  # Review the 8-phase state management plan

# Phase 1: Core State Infrastructure Setup
# - Global state management architecture
# - Zustand stores with persistence
# - State subscription patterns
```

**Why First**: State management is the foundation that all other features depend on. Without sophisticated state, advanced features cannot function.

### **Week 2: Story 7.6 - Notifications** (USER EXPERIENCE)
```bash
# Add comprehensive user feedback
cat 7.6.story.md  # Review the 8-phase notification plan

# Phase 1: Notification Infrastructure Setup
# - Global notification provider
# - Notification queue management
# - Notification types and priorities
```

**Why Second**: Notifications provide essential user feedback that makes the sophisticated state management visible and actionable.

### **Week 3: Story 7.10 - WebSocket** (REAL-TIME FOUNDATION)
```bash
# Complete real-time infrastructure
cat 7.10.story.md  # Review the 8-phase WebSocket plan

# Phase 1: WebSocket Infrastructure Setup
# - Complete WebSocket provider integration
# - Connection management and pooling
# - Heartbeat and health monitoring
```

**Why Third**: WebSocket infrastructure enables real-time features that bring the state management and notifications to life.

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Phase-by-Phase Implementation**
Each story has **8 detailed phases** - implement them incrementally:

```bash
# Story 7.5 Example - Phase 1
cd app/hooks
# Integrate useZones.ts, useDocument.ts, useUndoRedo.ts

# Story 7.6 Example - Phase 1  
cd app/components/feedback
# Integrate NotificationToast.tsx, LoadingOverlay.tsx

# Story 7.10 Example - Phase 1
cd app/providers
# Integrate websocket-provider.tsx with connection management
```

### **Integration Points Ready**
Each story includes **complete integration examples**:

- **Layout.tsx**: Global provider setup
- **DocumentUploadAndViewer.tsx**: Main component integration
- **DualPaneViewer.tsx**: Advanced feature integration
- **Custom hooks**: State and notification management
