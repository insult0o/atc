# PDF Intelligence Platform - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The PDF Intelligence Platform is an AI-powered system for extracting, processing, and managing content from PDF documents with high accuracy and user control. The platform combines multiple extraction tools with an interactive validation interface and structured export capabilities.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Multi-Tool Accuracy**: Leverages multiple PDF processing tools with confidence-based merging
- **Interactive Validation**: Dual-pane interface for visual comparison and correction
- **Structured Exports**: Generates AI-ready training data and RAG-compatible outputs
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation and testing throughout the process

## Key Features

### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline
- Multiple tool integration (unstructured, pdfplumber, pymupdf, camelot, tabula)
- Content type detection (text, tables, diagrams)
- Confidence scoring and thresholds
- Tool fallback and error handling

### 2. Interactive UI
- Dual-pane view (original vs. extracted)
- Visual confidence indicators
- Zone-based selection and editing
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

### 3. Export System
- RAG-ready JSON chunks
- Fine-tuning JSONL data
- User corrections tracking
- Comprehensive logging

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Next.js with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind v4 styling
- PDF.js for rendering
- Canvas for zone selection
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Backend
- Python/TypeScript hybrid
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- WebSocket support
- PDF processing tools integration
- Export format generation

### Testing
- Playwright for e2e testing
- MCP integration
- CI pipeline support
- Regression testing

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- Tool processing: < 30s per zone
- UI responsiveness: < 100ms
- Export generation: < 5s

### Quality
- Extraction accuracy > 95%
- User correction rate < 10%
- Export validation success > 99%
- Test coverage > 90%

## Project Constraints

### Technical
- PDF size limit: 100MB
- Max zones per page: 50
- Concurrent processing: 5 documents
- Export file size: < 1GB

### Integration
- Must support multiple PDF processing tools
- Real-time WebSocket updates required
- Structured export formats mandatory

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Tool Integration**: Complex integration of multiple PDF processing tools
2. **Performance**: Real-time processing and UI updates at scale
3. **Accuracy**: Maintaining high confidence scores across different content types
4. **Resource Usage**: Managing memory and processing resources effectively

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Modular tool integration with clear interfaces
2. Performance optimization and caching strategies
3. Comprehensive testing and validation pipeline
4. Resource monitoring and management system
