```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install

# Ensure test fixtures are available
mkdir -p tests/fixtures

```

## ðŸ“Š Test Reporting & Analysis

### **Generate Test Reports**
```bash
# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --reporter=html

# Generate JSON report for CI/CD
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --reporter=json:epic1-results.json

```

## ðŸ”§ Test Configuration & Environment

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Set test environment
export TEST_ENV=epic1_integration
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false
export PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=60000

# Development mode (with verbose logging)
export DEBUG=playwright:*
```

### **Test Data Setup**
```bash
# Ensure test fixtures exist
ls tests/fixtures/
# Should contain:
# - test-aviation-manual.pdf (5-10 pages)
# - aviation-manual-50p.pdf (50 pages)
# - large-aviation-manual-100p.pdf (100+ pages)
# - regression-baseline.pdf (baseline for regression tests)
# - invalid-file.txt (for validation tests)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Categories & Execution Strategy

### **1. Smoke Tests (Quick Validation)**
```bash
# Run basic functionality tests (~5 minutes)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/story4-foundation.spec.ts --grep="upload.*progress"
```

### **2. Integration Tests (Comprehensive)**
```bash
# Run full integration workflows (~20 minutes)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/integration-workflows.spec.ts
```

### **3. Performance Tests (Resource Intensive)**
```bash
# Run performance and stress tests (~45 minutes)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/performance.spec.ts --workers=1 --timeout=300000
```

### **4. Regression Tests (Baseline Validation)**
```bash
# Run regression validation (~15 minutes)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --grep="regression"
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. MCP Server Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Restart MCP server
cd mcp-servers && npm restart

# Verify MCP configuration
cat mcp-configs/playwright-config.json | jq .
```

#### **2. Test Fixture Not Found**
```bash
# Check fixture files
ls -la tests/fixtures/

# Download test fixtures (if needed)
wget https://example.com/test-files/aviation-manual.pdf -O tests/fixtures/test-aviation-manual.pdf
```

#### **3. Browser Launch Failures**
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --force

# Check browser dependencies
npx playwright install-deps
```

#### **4. WebSocket Connection Issues**
```bash
# Verify WebSocket endpoint is available
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" http://localhost:3000/api/ws

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -an | grep 3000
```

#### **5. Performance Test Timeouts**
```bash
# Increase timeout for large documents
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/performance.spec.ts --timeout=600000

# Run with single worker to reduce resource contention
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

## ðŸ“ˆ CI/CD Integration

### **GitHub Actions Example**
```yaml
name: Epic 1 E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  epic1-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      
      - name: Start application
        run: npm run dev &
        
      - name: Wait for application
        run: npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      
      - name: Run Epic 1 Tests
        run: npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/
      
      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## ðŸŽª Advanced Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Run concurrent user tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/integration-workflows.spec.ts --grep="Multi-User" --workers=4
```

### **2. Memory Leak Detection**
```bash
# Run with memory monitoring
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/performance.spec.ts --grep="Memory" --headed
```

### **3. Network Condition Testing**
```bash
# Test with slow network
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --config=slow-network.config.js
```

### **4. Visual Regression Testing**
```bash
# Update visual baselines
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --update-snapshots

# Run visual comparison tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/epic1/ --grep="visual"
```

## ðŸš€ Best Practices

### **1. Test Data Management**
- Use consistent test fixtures across environments
- Implement data cleanup after each test
- Version control test data with Git LFS

### **2. Test Isolation**
- Each test should be independent
- Use separate browser contexts for concurrent tests
- Clean up state between test runs

### **3. Error Handling**
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests
- Use appropriate timeouts for different operations
- Capture screenshots and traces on failures

### **4. Performance Optimization**
- Run performance tests on dedicated hardware
- Use parallel execution for independent tests
- Monitor resource usage during test execution
