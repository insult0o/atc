## Working Servers (7 total)

### TypeScript Servers
- ✅ **Filesystem** - File operations and directory management
- ✅ **Memory** - Persistent conversation memory
- ✅ **Everything** - Universal search capabilities  
- ✅ **Sequential Thinking** - AI reasoning and problem solving

### Python Servers
- ✅ **Fetch** - Web content fetching and HTTP requests
- ✅ **Git** - Version control and repository management
- ✅ **Time** - Timezone conversion and time calculations

## Configuration Files

- **Main Config**: \`~/.config/mcp/cursor-config.json\`
- **Local Copy**: \`./mcp-cursor-config.json\`
- **Virtual Environment**: \`./mcp-servers/venv/\`
- **Server Documentation**: \`./mcp-readmes/\`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Restart Cursor IDE
**IMPORTANT**: Close and reopen Cursor IDE completely for the MCP servers to be recognized.

### 2. Test Each Server
Try these commands in Cursor:

#### Filesystem
- "Create a file called test.txt with hello world"
- "List all markdown files in this directory"

#### Time
- "What time is it?"
- "Convert 3 PM EST to UTC"

#### Fetch  
- "Fetch content from https://example.com"
- "Get the title from a webpage"

#### Git
- "Show git status"
- "What branch am I on?"

#### Memory
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript"
- "What do you remember about me?"

#### Everything
- "Search for all TODO comments"
- "Find references to React"

#### Sequential Thinking
- "Help me think through this problem step by step"
- "Break down this task into smaller parts"

## 📚 Documentation

Each server has detailed documentation:
- \`./mcp-readmes/filesystem-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/fetch-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/git-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/time-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/memory-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/everything-README.md\`
- \`./mcp-readmes/sequential-thinking-README.md\`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Server Not Responding
1. Restart Cursor IDE completely
2. Check if MCP servers are enabled in Cursor settings
3. Verify configuration file syntax

### Python Errors
1. Ensure virtual environment is active
2. Check Python package installations
3. Verify file permissions

### TypeScript Errors
1. Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
2. Verify compilation was successful
3. Check file paths in configuration

## 🎯 Advanced Usage

### Combining Servers
You can use multiple servers together:
- "Use git to check status, then create a summary file"
- "Fetch content from a URL and save it to a file"
- "Search for TODOs and remember to fix them later"

### Best Practices
- Start with simple commands to test each server
- Use specific, clear instructions
- Be patient while servers initialize (first use)
- Check Cursor's console for any error messages
